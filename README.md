# In And Out Service for Carmen Steffens Group
HTML, CSS e JS (vanila) website that scan a QR Code and send the data to a Google Sheet to control in-and-out actions for a real event.

## ⚙️ Use Case

1. At the event entrance, an attendant will use the website's QR code scanner.

2. Upon scanning, if the QR code is valid, the website will display a feedback message to confirm the scan (to exit the feedback screen, just touch or click anywhere on the screen).

3. After successfully reading the QR code, the website will connect to a Google Sheets endpoint to transmit the scanned information.

4. This information will be logged in the appropriate sheet within the spreadsheet and monitored by the event's organizing team.

Below is a video demonstration detailing the process for those responsible for scanning the QR codes:
